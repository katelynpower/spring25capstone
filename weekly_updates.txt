Weekly Update 1 - 10 February 2025
	1. Set up environment including VSCode and GitHub Repo
	2. Generated final project proposal, which can be found in my repo here: https://github.com/GW-datasci/25-spring-KPower/blob/main/Proposals/202501/001/proposal_001.md
	3. Started first steps of loading in, cleaning, and exploring the data in R, as seen here: https://github.com/GW-datasci/25-spring-KPower/blob/main/code/component/cleaning_eda_R.R
Next week I plan to continue cleaning and EDA.

Weekly Update 2 - 24 February 2025
	1. Finished cleaning dataset with sorting and updating in R (same cleaning_eda file as above)
		- Downloaded a more recent version of the dataset and reran the previous cleaning code on it to apply changes
		- Exported my final cleaned dataframe as a CSV so I can work with it outside of R in the future
	2. EDA - began exploring the dataset statistically with summary statistics and trying out some ANOVA tests in R (same cleaning_eda file as above)
	3. Fixed organization for weekly update file in github
Next week I will finish up with any last EDA and start feature importance work

Weekly Update 3 - 3 March 2025
	1. Created a new R file for creating visualizations
		- I have decided that I want to move forward with visualizations before I do modeling, so that I can continue exploring the data
		- This file will be used for EDA specifically with visualizations so I can determine the best visualizations to move forward with and how to cut the data for them
	2. Started by creating two bar charts (one based on time and one based on category) and a pie chart
		- challenge: there are many categories so it is hard to make it pretty to read, and also I have to subset the data a lot
		- challenge: I thought that the estimates were percentages but they add up to much more than 100... need to reevaluate
Need to be more productive next week lol. Hoping to finalize the types of visualizations I want soon so I can start doing UI!

Weekly Update 4 - 17 March 2025
	1. Started up a UI with Plotly Dash Apps
	2. Began drafting out some visualizations based on my explorations from last week
		- started with a simple bar chart first, and figured out how I want to adjust it next to make it more user-friendly (also need to add more dropdowns because it is misleading right now)
		- might see what a tree map looks like next 
		- in the future I want to remove the "other" and "nothing" sentiments
		- in the future I want to split out the motivators/concerns into separate graphs to improve readability 
		- not sure if i will keep the timeframe dropdown...
	3. every other month only shows either motivators/concerns - I went back and combined these month's labels for 2 month intervals

Weekly Update 5 - 24 March 2025
	1. Fixed all of the things I talked about in point 2 from last week's update
		- removed irrelevant sentiment categories like "other" and "nothing"
		- split out the motivators and concerns into separate graphs
	2. Generally fixed layout and aesthetics of bar graphs. Still have some things I will tweak in the future but good to move on to other viz now.

Weekly Update 6 - 1 April 2025
	1. Added treemap to app
	2. Fixed minor layout/UI issues
	3. Tried out decision tree (decision_tree.py)
		- want to try simplifying/pruning the tree and see if there is a way to implement it into my app
		- will try regression or another model next
